The paper includes comparison between 3 regimes of radiation reaction: classical Landau-Lifschitz, Fokker-Planck and Boltzmann-Monte-Carlo.
In this notebook we only apply the Fokker-Planck pusher to reproduce figure 10 of the paper, where an electron beam loses energy as it interacts with a uniform-constant magnetic field.
